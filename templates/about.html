        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>
            In the farm, there are many types of crops and fruits, and many of them are infected during different seasons.
            These infections are mostly caused by insects. The goal of our Plant Disease Prediction project is to
            identify these plant infections early and help save crops from loss.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Plants attacked by insects are often unable to produce crops or fruits. If not addressed,
                the infection can spread to other plants, leading to widespread damage across the farm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Farmers face major losses due to reduced crop yields when their plants are unhealthy or infected.
                On the other hand, healthy crops grow better and produce more, increasing the farmerâ€™s income.
            </li>
            <li>
                Early identification of diseases helps farmers prevent the spread of infection throughout their farm.
            </li>
            <li>
                To prevent financial loss and improve productivity, we propose using a smart plant disease
                identification system.
            </li>
            <li>
                Our system quickly detects infected plants from leaf images, enabling farmers to take quick
                action before the disease spreads further.
            </li>
        </ul>
